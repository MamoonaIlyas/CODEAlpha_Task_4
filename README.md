Task Automation with Python Scripts
This Python script automates file organization by sorting files into categorized folders based on their extensions. It scans a specified directory, identifies file types such as images, documents, videos, music, archives, executables, and scripts, and moves them into corresponding subfolders. The script uses the os and shutil modules to check for file types, create necessary directories if they donâ€™t exist, and relocate files accordingly. Running the script prompts the user to enter a folder path, and upon execution, it neatly arranges files, making the workspace more structured and efficient. ðŸš€ðŸ“‚ #Python #Automation #FileManagement
